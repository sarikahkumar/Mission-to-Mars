# Overview of the project

The purpose of this analysis is to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images of MARS. I have used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images (provided below), store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
